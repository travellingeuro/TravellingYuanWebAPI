                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-0">
                    The main purpose of this web page is to recreate the life of a Dollar note as it travels all along China and other territories where it is used.
                    These journeys may be enriched with the user comments on the condition of the bill, what it was used for, the name of the place it was used, etc.<br />

                    The functioning is quite simple. Anyone can track any particular bill entering its serial number.
                    A table and a map will show where it has been and the comments previous users have entered about it.
                    If the note has not been previously added, you can add it on the grounds that you register an account. Just search for the location in the map and complete the rest of the form.<br />

                    The first time a note is added, based on its serial number, the place where it has been printed is automatically registered.<br />

                    However, some limitations apply:<br />

                    <span> &#8226;</span>A user can only register a particular bill once. The idea is to unveil how a note moves and changes from hand to hand and what it is used for.
                    There is no point in allowing a user to enter the same note over and over. In the extraordinary case that the same bill comes back to you over time, contact us.<br />
                    <span> &#8226;</span>The date of use is automatically set to the current date the bill is entered in the web page.If it is not the same (e.g. you are entering several notes that you have used in the past days) you can change it manually in your account´s page.<br />

                    A special case may arise when you are travelling within China. We suggest you collect a huge amount of notes and enter them upon arrival in another place*,
                    think that this can be close to a facebook-note-experience for them. Comments and questions are more than welcome.<br />

                    *If you gather a variety but feel lazy to enter them all at a time, just send them to us. We will be more than happy to help you..

                <h2>What triggers this project</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-0">
                    The idea behind travellingyuan.com is quite simple. If you live of have been visiting any of the countries that use the 
                    Renminbi, you probably have noticed the coins that you have in your pockets often come from represent different places. 
                    The same happens with the the Yuan bills, but it is not so easily noticeable. Yuan bills' serial numbers have a letter 
                    denoting which Mint -out of a total of five-issued them. Apart from that, it is not possible to determine the note's origin 
                    by simply looking at it. If being in  Guangzhou for instance, we use a bill printed in Beijing we can have a good idea of the 
                    journey that bill has made. But, where else has it been?, what have people purchased with it? how did it make to Guangzhou -by 
                    plane, car etc....? this is the kind of question that we have posed and pretend to answer with this humble project.

                <h2>So, what is the purpose?</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-0">
                    The main purpose is to create a community of users willing to share their experience using Renminbi currency to unveil 
                    how they move across China  (or other places where it is currency of. Only a valid email address is required to use this
                    page. We would like to gather accurate and relevant information, so some control measures are needed to avoid abuse. In
                    normal circumstances a bill note can be entered whenever it is in our hands. The scope of information entered in the 
                    "comments field" is up to you and anything is valid, except... well you know, just be nice and polite please. 
                    But the more info, the better the result can be.

                <p class="lead mb-0">
                    This project is absolutely amateur by now. The more code we write the more errors will appear for sure, we apologize for that.
                    As long as other obligations allow us we are working hard to improve the page and add new features. Your contributions and suggestions are welcome.
                    We read and appreciate all your comments even though we don't answer them all. Feel free to spread the word.<br />
                    Enjoy!
